					<h3>Steve Jobs - by Walter Isaacson</h3>
					<p>
						I bought my first Apple device (iPad 2) in the year 2011. But I've been fascinated with Jobs for a really long time ever since I watched "The Pirates of Silicon Valley" and later his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHWUCX6osgM">inspiring speech</a> at Stanford. A must read if you are a technology enthusiast or an entrepreneur/aspiring entrepreneur.

					<h3>Harry Potter - by J.K. Rowling</h3>
					<p>
						The day I finished reading The Philosopher's Stone I knew the world won't be same again. There will be muggles and there will be us wizards and witches. I was 17 then and in between my high school board exams.(A big deal in India) We used to have 3-4 days gap between each papers and I spent most of those days reading Harry Potter. My father realizing the gravity of the situation got me the fourh book Goblet of Fire so that I can finish reading the whole series and get back to studies.

					<h3>A Song of Ice and Fire - by George R.R. Martin</h3>
					<p>
						If you enjoyed reading Harry Potter when you were a kid, you will love A Song of Ice and Fire as an adult. After the second season of HBO's Game of Thrones ended I knew I couldn't wait a year more and bought myself the first five available books of the series. I have already read it once. But its such a complicated story with so many plots and sub-plots that I still discovered new things in the second round of reading.

					<h3>The Alchemist - by Paulo Coelho</h3>
					<p>
						The Alchemist written in a very simple fable like style. At times, you may find its simplicity underwhelming. However, it carries a strong message and will force to take a second look at your life, your aspirations and your dreams.
